# NP-3DP
NP Slicing is a graph-based pipeline for extracting topology-aware iso-curves from triangulated surfaces. It builds a weighted vertex graph from the mesh, detects and prunes critical points, synthesizes a boundary-conforming scalar field, and adaptively samples iso-curves with multi-component support.
